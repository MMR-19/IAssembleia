## ðŸ“ƒ Data Processing and Analysis

1. **Source**: [Portuguese Parliament Initiatives](https://www.parlamento.pt/Cidadania/Paginas/DAIniciativas.aspx). A JSON file with all initiatives, acts, polls and votes for the 16th Legislature.

2. **Data structure**: Extracted the original schema manually from the JSON file. See more at [schema.json](data/raw/schema.json).

3. Used the [data_exploration](data_exploration.ipynb) notebook to explore the dataset and save the relevant info to CSV files. See all files at [data/processed](data/processed).

4. Final data structure:
- **Hierarchy**: initiatives > acts > polls > votes.
- **Fields**: check the [image](data/processed/fields.png) at [data/processed](data/processed) for info on final processed fields.
