## ðŸ’¬ Azure OpenAI AI Agent that chats with CSV files

Check the [notebook](azure_llm.ipynb) to see how to implement a LangChain agent that can read a dataframe and answer context-aware questions!

Be sure to update the [.env](.env) file with Azure's API key and endpoint:

1. Create an [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?icid=openai-service)
2. Follow the steps to deploy a resource
3. Follow to Azure AI Foundry and deploy a model of your choice
4. Extract both the API Key and Inference Endpoint
5. Replace on .env file

## ðŸ“ƒ Data Processing and Analysis

1. **Source**: [Portuguese Parliament Initiatives](https://www.parlamento.pt/Cidadania/Paginas/DAIniciativas.aspx). A JSON file with all initiatives, acts, polls and votes for the 16th Legislature.

2. **Data structure**: Extracted the original schema manually from the JSON file. See more at [schema.json](data/raw/schema.json).

3. Used the [data_exploration](data_exploration.ipynb) notebook to explore the dataset and save the relevant info to CSV files. See all files at [data/processed](data/processed).

4. Final data structure and hierarchy: initiatives > acts > polls > votes.
